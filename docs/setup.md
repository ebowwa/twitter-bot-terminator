To run your Azure Functions locally and enable others to clone and use it, you need a straightforward setup guide. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of what's required and how to run your function:

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6.x or later**: Make sure Python is installed.
- **Azure Functions Core Tools**: Provides a local development environment.
- **Azure CLI**: Useful for managing Azure services.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python**:
   Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Azure Functions Core Tools**:
   Install via npm (Node.js package manager) with:
   ```bash
   npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@3 --unsafe-perm true
   ```

3. **Install Azure CLI**:
   Install the Azure CLI to interact with Azure services:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
   ```

### Clone the Repository
Have your friends clone the repository where your Azure Function is stored:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Local Setup

1. **Setup using Poetry**:
   Poetry will automatically create a virtual environment if one doesn't exist. To install Poetry and set up the environment, run:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using Poetry**:
   Ensure your project directory contains a `pyproject.toml` file with `azure-functions` listed as a dependency.
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### Run Locally

1. **Start the function**:
   Navigate to the function's root directory and run:
   ```bash
   func start
   ```

This will start the function app locally on your machine, typically accessible via `http://localhost:7071`. You can interact with your function by navigating to the specific endpoint defined in your code.

### Test the Function

- Open a web browser or use a tool like Postman to send requests to:
  ```
  http://localhost:7071/api/thot_terminator_endpoint?name=YourName
  ```

- You should see responses based on the input you provide.

This setup provides a minimal, effective way to run and test Azure Functions locally, making it easier for your friends to work with your project.
